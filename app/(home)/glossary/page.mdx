| Bitrate        	| Bitrate refers to the amount of data that is processed or transmitted per unit of time. Higher bitrates generally produce higher-quality video, but they also require more storage space and bandwidth for transmission. E.g., roughly based on different streaming services, ~8,000+ kb/s for 1080p and ~24,000+ kb/s for 2160p (x264) is generally the lower limit before compression starts to become more noticeable, though content can still look good below these ranges. However, it's worth noting that the relationship between bitrate and quality is not always linear. Factors like the codec, encoder settings, resolution, content complexity (how much stuff is happening in a scene), source, and release group, all play significant roles in determining the perceived quality. 	|
| Codec          	| A ‘codec’ is a specification on how to convert from raw data to images on a screen. When a video file is stored, there is a specific codec that converts that data into what you see. The two most common codecs for movies/TV are H.264, also called MPEG-4 AVC, and H.265, also known as HEVC, the latter being the successor to H.264.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	|
| Dubs / Dubbing 	| The term "dubbing" commonly refers to the replacement of the actor's voices with those of different performers speaking another language, which is called "revoicing" in the film industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| Fansub         	| Fansubs are unofficial subtitles for any show/movie. These can be original translations made by fans or just edits for a better experience.

| Remux          	| A remux is a release that has had its contents transferred from one container format to another. The video/audio in the new container will be identical to the ones in the original file, meaning there is no loss in quality. A common example of this is an unaltered Blu-ray release, where the container file on the Disc is converted into .mkv or .mp4. So a Blu-ray Remux indicates that it's a lossless rip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|

| Telesync/HDTS  	| A telesync or TS release is different from a typical CAM release as it has the potential for better-quality audio/video. The audio feed is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often from a hearing-impaired feed or an FM radio signal from a drive-in theater); the video feed is often, though not always, captured using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth, in which case the release is labeled as HDTS for HD video recordings. These are the main differences between CAM and TS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	|

| Bitrate           	| Bitrate refers to the amount of data used to encode digital music files. It affects the sound quality of the music, with higher bitrates generally resulting in better quality sound. When it comes to pirated music, the bitrate can vary depending on the source of the file. Lower bitrate files may result in poor quality, distortions or artifacts in the music. E.g High bitrate = 320 kilobits per second (kbps) & Low bitrate = anything below 128 kilobits (kbps). 	|

| Transparency      	| Transparency is a term used to describe the audible quality of a lossy music file. A lossy file is considered transparent if the average human cannot tell the difference between a lossy and a lossless version of the same song just by listening to both without knowing which file is which. For most people, MP3 192kbps (CBR) is considered transparent.                                                                                                               	|

|-------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Availability      	| The number of full copies of a file (or set of files and directories) directly available to the client. Each seed adds 1.0 to this number, as they have one complete copy of the file. A connected peer with a fraction of the file available adds that fraction to the availability, if no other peer has this part of the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| BitTorrent        	| The most widely used form of peer-to-peer filesharing. BitTorrent is a decentralised system which coodinates download distribution (see "Tracker") but doesn't host any downloads. Downloads are automatically segregated into pieces which are gathered from peers and re-assembled into usable files by the torrent client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
| Connectability    	| Connectability relates to the state of 'being connectable', meaning an incoming port on your computer is open, allowing other peers in the swarm to connect to you in order to share data. A connectable user can share data with anyone in the swarm, but an unconnectable user can't and is restricted to only those with open ports (More Info). Being 'unconnectable' also negatively affects the performance of the swarm and in some cases the speed of your download/upload.                                                                                                       	|
| Cross seed        	| When the same torrent is on two different trackers, you can donwload it from one, then seed to both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
| Freeleech         	| Freeleech means that the download size of the torrent does not count towards your overall ratio, only the uploaded amount on the torrent counts toward your ratio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| Hash              	| The hash is a digital fingerprint in the form of a string of alphanumeric characters (typically hexadecimal) in the .torrent file that the client uses to verify the integrity of data that is being transferred. "Hash" is the shorter form of the word "hashsum". Torrent files contain information such as the URL of the torrent's tracker, a list of files contained within a torrent, their size, format, and relevant attributes. The torrent client will check each "piece" of the torrent against the hash. If it fails verification, the data is discarded and requested again. 	|
| Hit-and-run (HnR) 	| To HnR means to intentionally leech a torrent. If you HnR on Private Trackers, you will likely be penalized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              	|
| Leech             	| The more accurate definition of Leech is a BitTorrent user that has a negative effect on the swarm, usually by performing a HnR. The term is also often used to describe peers, i.e., users that simply haven't downloaded 100% of the torrent yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	|
| Magnet            	| A Magnet is the hyperlink form of a torrent file, containing the same metadata as the .torrent equivalent. More specifically, its a URI scheme that defines the format of magnet links. More Info                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| Peer              	| A peer is one instance of a BitTorrent client running on a computer on the Internet to which other clients connect and transfer data. Depending on context, "peer" can refer either to any client in the swarm or more specifically to a downloader, a client that has only parts of the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	|
| Port Forwarding   	| Port forwarding lets computers access content or services hosted behind your home network by opening a specific port on your router. In the context of torrenting, this is done to improve connectability (see "Connectability") in the swarm, enabling you to seed more effectively and potentially achieve better speeds, especially for torrents with fewer seeds. Port Forwarding Guide                                                                                                                                                                                               	|
| Private Tracker   	| A private tracker is a BitTorrent tracker that restricts use by requiring users to register with the site. The method for controlling registration used among many private trackers is an invitation system, in which active and contributing members are given the ability to grant a new user permission to register at the site, or a new user goes through an interview process.                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
| Public Tracker    	| Public or open trackers can be used by anyone by adding the tracker address to an existing torrent, or they can be used by any newly created torrent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	|
| Ratio             	| Ratio or Share Ratio is a number determined by dividing the amount of data that user has uploaded by the amount of data they have downloaded. Final share ratios over 1.0 carry a positive connotation in the BitTorrent community, because they indicate that the user has sent more data to other users than they received. Likewise, share ratios under 1 have negative connotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   	|
| Seed / Seeding    	| A seed refers to a machine possessing all of the data (100% completion). A peer or downloader becomes a seed when it completely downloads all the data and starts uploading data for other peers to download from. Seeding is the uploading of already downloaded content for others to download from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	|
| Seedbox           	| A Seedbox is a server box that is rented each month to download and seed torrent files. Seedboxes are generally used for the uploading and downloading of digital files generally making use of the BitTorrent protocol though they can also be used on other file sharing websites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
| Super-Seeding     	| Super-Seeding (aka 'Initial Seeding') is an algorithm for the BitTorrent communications protocol that helps downloaders become uploaders more quickly, but it introduces the danger of total seeding failure if there is only one downloader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
| Swarm             	| All peers (including seeds) sharing the same content are called a swarm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	|
| Torrent           	| A torrent file or meta-info file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| Tracker           	| A BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol. The "tracker" server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines, which ones are available at time of the client request, and helps coordinate efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	|
